## Description
The README Generator speeds up the process of generating informative and attractive README documents for new or existing repositories. Using a predefined README structure and a series of command line prompts, the README Generator collects general information and technical details from the user about their repository and how it's meant to be interacted with. For more technical sections such as Installation or Usage, the application opens a text editor to allow the user to provide more detailed responses including code snippets and custom markdown. Once all of the necessary information information has been collected and returned, the application generates a clean, professionally formatted README populated with the user's responses.

## Technologies
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Inquirer.js
* Command Line
* Vim (OS X) / Notepad (Windows)

## Installation
Before proceeding, verify that Node.js and npm are installed on your device. To check whether Node.js and npm are installed, open a terminal and run:
```
node -v
```
```
npm -v
```
If Node and npm are already installed, the commands above should return version numbers. Visit [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for full installation details and documentation.  

The README Generator also requires the [Inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) package. To install Inquirer and its dependencies from npm, navigate to the project's root directory and run:
```
npm install
```
Once Inquirer.js and its dependencies have been installed, the application is ready to use.

## Usage
To launch the application from the command line, navigate to the project's root directory and run:
```
node index.js
```
Questions that may require code blocks, markdown, or more details responses will prompt the user to open their device's default text editor. These questions will prompt the user to press "enter" to open their operating system's default text editor:
* **Windows Users:** The application will open Notepad.
* **Mac/Linux Users:** The application will open Vim. Once Vim is open, press "i" to begin typing. Once finished, press "esc" to complete the input followed by ":wq" to save and close the editor. For a more detailed list of Vim commands, check out [this collection](https://www.radford.edu/~mhtay/CPSC120/VIM_Editor_Commands.htm) courtesy of Radford University.  

Each of the command line prompts is designed to connect user input to a specific section or component of the predefined README template. The final README generated by the application will include the following sections: **Description, Technologies, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, Questions**, and an interactive table of contents.
